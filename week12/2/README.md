We can use multiple buttons in your todo list app to allow the user to delete items in the todo list. In future versions, we may use buttons to let the user mark items as done, and to rearrange items as well. Let's get some practice. Make an HTML server that shows a page with a number and three buttons. The number should start at 0. The first button should say 'reset', when the user clicks this button, reset the number to 0. The second button should say '+', when the user clicks this button, the number should go up by one. The last button should say '-' and it should cause the number to go down by one.

Implement this server by writing `let number = 0` outside of the HTTP handler. Return HTML that includes the number and a form with the three buttons. Handle requests differently based on which button was pressed. Good luck!
