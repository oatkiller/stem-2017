The file `server.js` contains an HTTP server than will send `index.html` when the client navigates to the root (i.e. `/`)

When the user navigates to /cats.jpg, a cat pic is sent.

The html references the cat pic, and if you run the server, you will see that the HTML loads, and then the cat pic is also requested an loaded.

# Exercise
Using this server as a starting point, make a Website for yourself.
