`server.js` has a very basic message app. The `index.html` shows a form. When the user submits the form, the page reloads. Messages are kept in an array and all messages are written out.

# Instructions
You will need to install co-body in order to use this example. To do that:

`npm install`

or 

`npm install co-body`

Then run the server as usual

`node server.js`

# Exercise
Modify the application so that a user can enter their name. Show the name in the list of messages. That way, other users can see who wrote what.
