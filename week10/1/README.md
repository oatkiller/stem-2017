`server.js` contains an HTTP server

Run the server and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Make sure it works.

Using an if-statement, add support for the following feature:

If the user navigates to `http://localhost:3000/time`, show them the current time.

If the user navigates to `http://localhost:3000/ip`, show them their IP (the current functionality.)
